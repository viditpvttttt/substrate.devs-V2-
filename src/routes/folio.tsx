              Folio starts as a dashboard — the weather you will actually walk through, the four
              topics you care about, what your calendar is about to ask of you. Ask it something and
              the same surface becomes an assistant with your memory already loaded. Hand it a
              repository or a research question and it becomes an agent that works while you watch,
              step by step, with every file edit and every source it opened laid out in the open.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Nothing is hidden behind a chat transcript. Agents show their plan before they run,
              memory is a list you can read and delete line by line, and every synthesised answer
              keeps the links it came from.
